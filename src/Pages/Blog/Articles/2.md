## Writing is Hard

So it turns out writing is hard. I set out to write a blog post about the communication system between my player and the units they control, in my first game prototype ([link here](https://github.com/leavemydogalone/Prototype)), and it turned into 10 hours of writing, deleting, rewriting and never actually to a point that I thought people would want to read what I had written. My goal was to write a "technical document" that anyone could read. The result was something that was slightly too technical for a general audience, and not technical enough to highlight the parts of the system I developed to make the text interesting. 

The worst part of it was it was just SO BORING. Every time I started detailing one part of the code, I thought in my head, "oh well if I talk about this feature, I need to explain why this decision was so important, and so I need to explain this other aspect of programming or game development that this problem runs up against and that makes my decision so cool", and so every discussion of something I thought was cool, would also require just as many words on peripheral stuff that I didn't actually want to include, and I don't think anyone would want to read.

This blog post is a holdover as I experiment with other formats that I enjoy writing and other people might enjoy reading. And also, maybe I never find that *right* format and this is my last blog post, and that is OK too. Thank you for reading!
