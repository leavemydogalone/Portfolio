Hello! This is my first devblog post related to my first video game prototype that I made all on my own! For lack of a better name, I will just call it Turn-Based Multiplayer Prototype (or **TBMP** for short). Right now, I am around the 4 month mark of development on this project and I think it is time to put it to rest.

I am super proud of all the I was able to get done and all the stuff I was able to learn, but it is unfortunately missing a pretty key component: fun. Because of this, I will be moving on to my next project, where I will make "finding the fun" one of the first steps in development, rather than attempting to shove it in at the end. Before I do move on, I wanted to share some of the highlights of this development journey.

This first post will serve as an overview of the project goals and general design ideas, where later posts will dive deeper into specific design and programming topics that were the most interesting to me.

### My Goals

This project began with a mixture of ideas that I thought they would offer a great learning opportunity to explore systems that interested me; the big three ideas I wanted to tackle were **multiplayer using a dedicated server**, **Unreal's Gameplay Ability System (GAS)**, and a **turn-based** game system.

### Unreal and Stephen Ulibarri

Multiplayer games are, and always have been, my favorite video games, and so I knew early on that I needed to learn how to develop a multiplayer game. According to many online sources (Reddit), Unreal is _the_ game engine for multiplayer. According to Reddit, _competitive_ multiplayer games in Unreal, additionally, should use GAS and a dedicated server. Among the online game development community, Unreal was the toughest of the popular engines to learn, multiplayer games are more complicated than non-multiplayer games, and GAS lacked good documentation. I knew from the outset, I had a long learning journey ahead of me.

Luckily for me, when I first got interested in Unreal, I stumbled upon the Udemy course creator, Stephen Ulibarri. Over the next 2 years, Stephen would be my main teacher for all things Unreal. His courses cover everything from basic C++ - the programming language used in Unreal - to implementing multiplayer and GAS. His courses also offered access to his community of learners, whose comments and questions were _as_ integral to my learning as the actual course materials.

### Unreal's Gameplay Ability System

The official documentation and learning materials provided for GAS are not great; they are, as a matter of fact, largely non-existent. Your options used to be a) surface level Youtube videos that offered good introductions to GAS's systems or b) the Lyra project, which was Unreal's attempt to demonstrate how they would structure a multiplayer project, using GAS. Unfortunately, Lyra is an absolute behemoth of a project and is not only _not_ a suitable learning source for people new to GAS due to the project's size and complexity, it also kind of runs like crap, so I would hesitate to use it as a base for any of my own projects.

So, last year, I was beyond excited to see that Stephen was releasing his own course on GAS, and I would have a trustworthy source for (almost) all of my needed learning.

### Design and Turn-Based Games

Now, I needed to decide what game I actually wanted to make. Over the two years of learning, I was constantly adding and editing game design documents in notes on my phone. I loved going on walks, taking showers, and doing chores, as these offered opportunities for my brain to explore all the possible designs my game could implement. A game that hasn't been developed yet could be **anything**, and that made this ideation process always interesting, as there was so much design space to explore.

With a few design ideas fleshed out, I saw a common throughline with them: "something turn based". This meant adding one more thing to my list of learning goals, but at least this subject didn't _initially_ look like it would add too much to my plate. Luckily for me (again), some of the members of the Unreal GAS community put together a simple working [example](https://github.com/Narxim/Narxim-GAS-Example) of a turn-based system in a multiplayer game, that also uses GAS. If anyone reading this wants to learn GAS, but doesn't want to watch 100 hours of Stephen Ulibarri's course, this example and the Unreal Discord's Gameplay Ability System channel, where the creators of this example hang out, are probably the next best thing.

### Wrapping it Up

So, my learning went C++ -> dabbling in a couple courses for Unreal's Blueprint system and Multiplayer -> GAS. Over the 4 months following the completion of the GAS course, I developed the prototype for a game that can be found on [my Github](https://github.com/leavemydogalone/Prototype), now! For anyone interested, I have included a video in the ReadMe of the Github repo that walks through the specifics of the game's systems.

Is the code clean? Not really!

Is it optimized? Definitely not!

Does it work? Mostly.

I am super proud to say I achieved _most_ of the design and learning goals I set out to achieve in this project, and I will carry what I learned forward into the next things I do. I am excited to share more with you in my coming posts.
